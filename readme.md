# GlyphStatus

Keep track of your alts' missing glyphs.

## Usage

When logging into a character the addon will automatically populate a database
with the character's missing glyphs which you then can view (from any other
character) by running `/gs <name of character>`. Useful if you want to have a
glyph making marathon on your scribe.

## Hints

You can use `/gs me` as a shortcut for your current character.
